# Determining_Warmup_Period_for_a_Simulation
This project was my 3rd Homework for the course IE 306 (Systems Simulation) at Bogazici University.

## Details
This project uses SimPy framework for Python to implement discrete event simulation easily. The two different methods for determining the warm-up periods are given in the project description file. The detailed anaysis and the determined warm-up periods can be found in the project report.

## To Run the Code
**_(This procedure is for phase 1. Same applies for phase 2)_**

**_(Make sure runner_phase1.py and simulaiton_phase1.py files are in the same directory; or, if not, change the path in the runner_phase1.py file accordingly.)_**

First determine the random seed and how many times the simulation should be run with changing the hardcoded variables in the runner_phase1.py file:

```RANDOM_SEED = <YOUR RANDOM SEED>```

```REP_COUNT = <HOW MANY TIMES THE SIMULATION SHOULD BE RUN```

Then simply run the runner file:

```python3 runner_phase1.py```
